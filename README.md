Decentralized CFP selection in Conferences

# Problem

  Wherever there is centralization, there will be distrust. Centralization is responsible somehow most of the bad things happening in the society like cold war, divorce, breakup, distrust etc. There is one segment where very few people think of about is the conference.

### Current scenario of conferences: 

Conference organizers will poach to sponsors or vice versa. Organizers will get the money and give them the slot they wanted. Organizers very rarely care about the interest of attendees who are coming from across the globe. It's like you pay the money and get the slot. Because of that there are many times attendees have to listen talk which they don't want to listen or less preferred talk.

Attendees are investing time and money to listen something which they less preferred. In result, they return their office/home with just having visiting card of people who were in conferences.


# Solution:

Building a decentralized conference portal where attendees can vote the talk which they wanted to listen. By doing so, attendees will get something to learn which they wanted.

### How this will work
* Organizers will propose the name of conference,topics on which they wanted to organizes the conferences.
* They will select the time when they wanted to result be freeze, paid/unpaid conference, audience size, no. of tracks, name of each tracks.
* Speakers will submit their proposal.
* List of proposed speakers will be available to everyone.
* Attendees who are attending the conference will vote the proposal by paying gas fee if the conference is open to all.
* In case, if there will be some charges, then they will pay the fee in Ether and can also vote for the excited proposal. This will be done from the same address.
* On the freeze time, all votes will be counted.
* Top speakers selected by attendees will be shown on dashboard.
* Organizers need to provide slot to only those speakers.
##### By doing so, attendees will get what they wants and organizers will be more credible then before among attendees.

There might be lots of enhancement needed. We are open to suggestions in form of issues and PRs.
