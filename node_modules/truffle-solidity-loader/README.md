## truffle-solidity-loader

A Webpack loader allows importing a solidity contract that return a truffle artifact json object. This allows you to develop your contracts with Hot Reloading support, and have your migrations automatically re-run on change. When you run a production build, the contracts will be bundled into your main bundle for easy deployment.

## Example

```javascript
var provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545");
var contract = require("truffle-contract");

// Instead of including a built json file
import myContract_artifacts from '../build/contracts/MyContract.json'
var MyContract = contract(myContract_artifacts)

//You can import the solidity contract directly
import myContract_artifacts from '../contracts/MyContract.sol'
var MyContract = contract(myContract_artifacts)

MyContract.setProvider(provider);
```

You can see this plugin in operation in the [Truffle+Webpack Demo App](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-webpack-demo). The demo is for Truffle 4.0 & Webpack 4

## Installation

`$ npm install --save-dev truffle-solidity-loader`

Add the appropriate config to your `loaders` section of your Webpack 4 config:

```javascript
{
  test: /\.sol/,
  use: [
    {
      loader: 'json-loader'
    },
    {
      loader: 'truffle-solidity-loader',
      options: {
        network: 'ganache',
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Webpack applies loaders [right to left](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#pitching-loader), therefore the output of `truffle-solidity-loader` goes into `json-loader`.


### `truffle.js` integration

The loader will auto detect a `truffle.js` (or `truffle-config.js` for Windows users) config file in your project and use that for configuration.

### Loader options

  - `migrations_directory`: The path truffle migration scripts
  - `network`: A network name to use
  - `contracts_build_directory`: path to directory of truffle JSON artifacts

```javascript
{
  test: /\.sol/,
  use: [
    {
      loader: 'json-loader'
    },
    {
      loader: 'truffle-solidity-loader',
      options: {
        network: 'ganache',
        migrations_directory: path.resolve(__dirname, './migrations'),
        contracts_build_directory: path.resolve(__dirname, '../build/contracts')
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
